    <h2>Work Experience</h2>

    <h3>Cray Inc./Hewlett Packard Enterprise</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Worked at Cray headquarters in Seattle, WA over the 2022 summer from May to Mid-August</li>
        <li>Worked as a ML/AI Engineer intern where I helped develop an application to help users train ML models
            distributively on a range of their own computer clusters.</li>
        <li>Had the opportunity and privilege to work alongside and learn from some of the most skilled
            software/systems engineers I have ever met.</li>
        <li>Developed Bash scripts to allow developers to launch jobs remotely via REST calls under the privacy of their
            own user account.</li>
        <li>Learned multiple developer skills such as Docker, Kubernetes, Maven, Unix/Linux, Bash, Go, SSL, SSH, RESTful
            API, and more.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Engineering and Mathematics Tutor</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Used my knowledge of science and engineering to help various students in their respective disciplines.</li>
        <li>Broke down complex subjects such as multi-variable calculus, linear algebra, and calculus-based physics into
            simpler, more easily digestible bits of information.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Robotics Team Member</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Helped lead a team of programmers which ultimately made it to Texas High School FTC robotics state
            championship (cancelled due to COVID).</li>
        <li>Worked with different image recognition frameworks such as OpenCV and tensorflow to program robot to
            autonomously recognize and transfer objects.</li>
        <li>Developed key problem solving and engineering skills, both technical and mechanical.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Academic and Research Experience</h2>
    <p>I do not currently have a research position at my academic institution. However, I am in the process of searching
        for faculty to advise me in conducting research next semester. I am
        very interested in High-Performance Computing, Graph Theory, Machine Learning/Distributed Learning, and Graph
        Algorithms.
