      <h2>About Cameron</h2>
      <p>
        I am a current Junior at Texas A&M University pursuing a dual-degree (B.S.) in computer science and applied
        mathematics. I am also a proud member of the Craig and Galen Brown Engineering Honors program. Many people often
        me why I have chosen this "path of most resistance." The answer is: I truly have a deep passion for both these
        fields
        (also I'm a kind of a nerd at heart).
      </p>
      <p>
        Computer science is such a diverse discipline which has application in almost every field imaginable. As
        computer
        scientists, we can work together, with resources directly at our fingertips, to help solve problems of all
        shapes
        and sizes. With that being said, this field would not be possible without the eloquent notation and theoretical
        understanding that mathematics provides us. William Thurston put it best when he noted that "Mathematics is an
        art
        of human understanding."
      </p>
      <p>
        With these things being said, I am eager to work at the crossroad of mathematics and computer science to try and
        bride
        the gap between the past, present, and future. I am particularly interested in High-Performance Computing,
        Parallel
        Computing,
        and Graph Theory and its applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am a member of the Sigma Chi Fraternity at Texas A&M and have served on our Spring and Fall rush committees
        where
        met and evaluated
        potential new members. Additionally, I have served as the chair of parent relations for the last two semesters
        and
        counting.
        Aside from these accolades, this group is where I have met some of my lifelong friends! I grew up in Chicago and
        then moved to Houston
        right around middle school. This summer, I had the opportunity to live in Seattle for an internship and loved
        it.
        I
        love to travel and
        hope I can live in more cool places as my career progresses. Aside from these things, I love to cook, watch
        films,
        and play basketball.
