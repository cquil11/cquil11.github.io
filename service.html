            <h2>Youth Basketball Coach</h2>
            <p>I love the sport of basketball. In high school, I had the opportunity of coaching a team of 4th graders
                for
                two years. During that time, I composed practice plans which consisted of a range of drills and
                activities.
                Having chance to teach children about a game I enjoy so much was truly a privilege and was quite fun.
                Even
                today, I still see some of my team members and always take the chance to catch up with them.
            </p>
            <h2>Mathematics and Science Tutor</h2>
            <p>In high school and more recently in college, I have volunteered (without pay) to teach kids mathematics
                and
                engineering. Like coaching basketball, I believe that having the opportunity to teach something you love
                to
                do is a privilege. I always take pride in my teaching and strive to instill a sense of understanding in
                my
                students so as to help build their academic confidence.</p>
