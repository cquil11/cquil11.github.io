            <ul>
                <li>Worked at <a href="https://www.hpe.com/us/en/compute/hpc.html">Cray Inc.</a> headquartered in Seattle, WA over the 2022 summer from May to Mid-August</li>
                <li>Worked as a ML/AI Engineer intern where I helped develop an application to help users train ML
                    models
                    distributively on a range of their own computer clusters.</li>
                <li>Had the opportunity and privilege to work alongside and learn from some of the most skilled
                    software/systems engineers I have ever met.</li>
                <li>Developed Bash scripts to allow developers to launch jobs remotely via REST calls under the privacy
                    of
                    their
                    own user account.</li>
                <li>Learned multiple developer skills such as Docker, Kubernetes, Maven, Unix/Linux, Bash, Go, SSL, SSH,
                    RESTful
                    API, and more.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Engineering and Mathematics Tutor</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Used my knowledge of science and engineering to help various students in their respective
                    disciplines.
                </li>
                <li>Broke down complex subjects such as multi-variable calculus, linear algebra, and calculus-based
                    physics
                    into
                    simpler, more easily digestible bits of information.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Robotics Team Member</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Helped lead a team of programmers which ultimately made it to Texas High School <a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/ftc">FTC robotics</a> state
                    championship (cancelled due to COVID).</li>
                <li>Worked with different image recognition frameworks such as OpenCV and tensorflow to program robot to
                    autonomously recognize and transfer objects.</li>
                <li>Developed key problem solving and engineering skills, both technical and mechanical.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Academic and Research Experience</h2>
            <p>I do not currently have a research position at my academic institution. However, I am in the process of
                searching
                for faculty to advise me in conducting research next semester. I am
                very interested in High-Performance Computing, Graph Theory, Machine Learning/Distributed Learning, and
                Graph
                Algorithms.
                <br>
                <br>
                Here are some things I have been reading...
